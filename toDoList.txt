To Do List for Wuddup Website

 - Add additional horizontal section above the footer in the index.html page because it would have a better look if it didn't end on a whitespace background
 - Find ideas for the design of the other pages and start developing those pages
 - Decide what the "Wuddup" page is going to be (what content will it hold?) so you decide on how you want to style it (do we need a 4th page?)
 - Create a minimum size for certain parts of websites that fit well on a phone screen, but then allow them to grow larger (up to a max size) for larger screens. Use the flex shrink grow and basis properties to help facilitate this with a minimum and maximum size.
 - Might be good practice to rename the image files to something less cumbersome to deal with, just saying.
 - Edit cards on index.html to have more visual similarity with the tiles on the games.html page. (try to have the visuals flow between pages)
